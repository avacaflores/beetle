Pork scratchings is a snack food made from the fried or roasted skin and fat of a pig. It is often sold in retail stores in small bags in the same way that potato chips/crisps are. Some people cannot help themselves when they hear the pharse 'pork scratchings' and will make yum-yum noises with their mouth whilst licking their lips. Other people are shocked by the idea of purposely eating fried fat and will often make a facial expression involving the crunching of the nose and extension of the tongue.
